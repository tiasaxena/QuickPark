# “QuickPark” an open innovation project
### What is QuickPark?
- QuickPark is a smart-parking application
- It uses location tracking to display the available parking slots in nearby regions, primarily malls, markets and restaurants.
- Saving customers’ time, effort along with fuel conservation is the main idea behind the project. 

### What problem it Solves?
 - Our application ensures that the user finds a safe spot to park their vehicle and henceforth conserves valuable time, fuel, and needless hassle.

### How does it work?
- The user can simply get registered to our site, and proceed to search for the availability of parking slots in the desired location through the integrated map interface. To confirm their booking,  they can simply click on the ‘book now’ button and fill in the required details. Upon submitting, a confirmation message will pop up, confirming the booking.
